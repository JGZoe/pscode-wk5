// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Start
2. Input firstNumber
3. Input secondNumber
4. Sum = A + B
5. Output sum
6. Print
7. End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Input number
3. If (number modulo 2) = 0, then
4. 	Output "Even"
5. Else
6.	Output "Odd"
7. End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  

n= Input “Enter 5 integer value”


b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

1. Input firstNumber
2. Input secondNumber
3. Input thirdNumber
4. Input fourthNumber
5. Input fifthNumber
6. sum = firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber + fourthNumber + fifthNumber
7. average = sum / 5
8. Output average


c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Read inputNumber
	If inputnumber < smallest
		SET smallest To inputNumber
	END IF

	IF inputNumber > largest
		SET largest TO inputnumber
	END IF
END FOR

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Display "The average being Output average"
Display "The least being "smallest", the greatest being "largest""
